# Toy Problem - Ruby

## Multiplication Without `*` Operator

### Objectives

1. Practice thinking through abstract algorithms.
2. Properly use common data structures.

Write an algorithm that finds the [mathematical product](https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/product.html) of two whole, positive numbers without using the `*` operator (a.k.a. the "times" operation). That is, do multiplication without actually using the multiplication operator.

So if you gave your algorithm the numbers `10` and `3`, it would respond with `30`, because in math `10 x 3` equals 30. Programming makes this easy, because you can do `10 * 3` in most languages, including Ruby. Your goal is to write code that finds the result of multiplication _without using the `*` operator_.

Remember that you only need to write the algorithm for whole, positive numbers. So you don't have to worry at all about fractions, decimals, or negative numbers.
